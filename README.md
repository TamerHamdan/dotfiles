## T Unix Dotfiles

This repo tracks my journey of building my ideal development environment.  
I like to keep things close to default, portable, minimalist, and easy to maintain (not to mention looking good :).  
My goal is minimal friction between having a thought and building it.

### What's In here?
- Neovim (Kickstart-based, but evolving)
- Tmux, Ghostty, Aerospace, Zsh configs...
- Custom scripts
